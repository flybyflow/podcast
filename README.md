## Search for Podcast Episode

The user can search the itunes store podcast library.
Selecting a podcast brings up its episode list. 
Selecting an episode will launch the audio Player .
The user can also download a Podcast by swiping right on an episode.

## Audio Player

On launch, the podcast episode automatically starts playing.

Here's the available controls for the audio player :

 - Resume/Pause audio playback by tapping play/pause button
 - Foward audio playback by 15 seconds by tapping the forward button
 - Rewind audio playback by 15 seconds by tapping the rewind button
 - Play at a specific time by dragging the top slider to the desired time
 - Adjust Volume by dragging the bottom slider to the desired volume

the audio player can be minimized using the dismiss button at the top or with a swiping down gesture. Once minimized it can be popped back with a tap or swipe up gesture.

## Downloads

The user can access the downloaded podcast episode by selecting "Downloads" in the bottom tab. 
This action will display all the fully downloaded podcast episodes.

selecting an episode will display the audio player and will play the media file stored on the device - this part doesnt require a network connection.

This section is persistent and so are media files associated with the downloaded Podcasts
